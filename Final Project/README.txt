README.txt:
	This file is just a quick brief on what the submission contains.

CS M117-SWE-Scavenger Report.pdf:
	An 8 page report going in-depth on the implementation, struggles and more about our project.

CS M117-SWE-Scavenger Presentation.pdf
	A presentation in pdf format that highlights the aspects of our application and is used in tandem
	with a live demo.

CS M117-SWE-Scavenger Code.zip
	This is a ~25 MB Zipped file containing all the source code for the project. This project was written
	for iOS in Swift, but includes Version Control with git and uses a dependency manager known as Cocoapods.
	The zipped file contains only the source code, and none of the frameworks, because this proved to be too large
	for submission. It does contain the Podfile to install the cocoapods frameworks if needed. You would have to create
	your own Xcode project and import all the code for this to work. Alternatively you can always send either of us 
	an email to get access to the Github repo for testing. Else the code itself can be viewed in any text editor such as
	Vim or Emacs.
	NOTE: The project is called MemCap due to the initial name, but if the application is run and installed on your 
	device it will be so as Scavenger!
